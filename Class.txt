We have to scrape/get date of Exoplanets (201 pages). Later we will analyze this date to know more about exoplanets.

Lets create a virtual environment.

Create Virtual Environment:- python3 -m venv venv
Activate Virtual Environment:- source venv/bin/activate

BS4
bs4 (BeautifulSoup) is a python module, which is famously used for parsing text as HTML and then performing actions in it, such as finding specific HTML tags with a particular class/id, or listing out all the li tags inside the ul tags.

Install bs4:-
* pip install bs4.

SELENIUM
Selenium, on the other hand, is used to interact with the webpage. It is famously used for automation testing, such as testing the functionality of a website (Login/Logout/etc.) but can be also used to interact with the page such as clicking a button, etc.

Install selenium:-
* pip install selenium.
